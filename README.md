# My Own Programming Language
This is my programming language designed by me, it's a simple language that supports basic programming constructs like variable assignment, arithmetic operations,loops,conditionals and switch statements

# Grammar
This language consists of the following terminals and non-terminals:

# Terminals
identifier: A string thats starts with a letter and may contain letters,digits and underscores.

digit: A number that contains positive or integer set of real numbers or floating numbers (with or without exponential number).

# Non-terminals
<program_language>: The starting symbol that represents a program.

<stmt_list>: A non-terminal that represents a list of statements.

< content > : A non-terminal that represents the declaration or assignment statement or if condition or switch case or for loops. 
	
	
< declare >: A non-terminal that represents a variable declaration.
	
< assign >: A non-terminal that represents an assignment statement.
	
	
< if_stmt >: A non-terminal that represents if condition.	
	
< operation >: A non-terminal that represents operators.
	
< for_stmt >: A non-terminal that represents a for loop assignment.
	
< update_stmt >: A non-terminal that represents a for loop increment or decrement.

# Example

Here's an example that represents the declaration and for loops
